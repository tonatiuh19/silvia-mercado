echo "üìã STEP-BY-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo ""

echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ FIRST TEST - Direct file access:"
echo "   Try: https://silviamercadofinanzas.com/new_demo/index.html"
echo "   ‚úÖ If this works: Problem is with .htaccess routing"
echo "   ‚ùå If this doesn't work: Problem is with file upload/folder structure"
echo ""

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ VERIFY FOLDER STRUCTURE in HostGator cPanel:"
echo "   Your structure should be EXACTLY:"
echo "   public_html/"
echo "   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ new_demo/"
echo "       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html"
echo "       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .htaccess"
echo "       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico"  
echo "       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robots.txt"
echo "       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ placeholder.svg"
echo "       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/"
echo "           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-CL3Z0gLR.js"
echo "           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-jUBi1JL4.css"
echo ""

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ CHECK FILE PERMISSIONS:"
echo "   - Folders (new_demo, assets): 755"
echo "   - Files (.htaccess, index.html, etc): 644"
echo ""

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ REPLACE .HTACCESS with minimal version:"
echo "   Delete current .htaccess and upload this content:"
echo "   ----------------------------------------"
cat deploy-new_demo/.htaccess-simple
echo "   ----------------------------------------"
echo ""

echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ ALTERNATIVE: Try without subfolder routing first"
echo "   Temporarily rename .htaccess to .htaccess-backup"
echo "   Then test: https://silviamercadofinanzas.com/new_demo/"
echo "   If you get a React app (even with wrong routes), upload works"
echo ""

echo "6Ô∏è‚É£ CHECK HOSTGATOR ERROR LOGS:"
echo "   - In cPanel ‚Üí Error Logs"
echo "   - Look for errors when accessing /new_demo/"
echo "   - Common errors: mod_rewrite not enabled, syntax errors"
echo ""

echo "7Ô∏è‚É£ NUCLEAR OPTION - Test in root first:"
echo "   - Upload files to public_html/ directly (not in subfolder)"
echo "   - If it works there, the issue is subfolder-specific"
echo ""

echo "üö® MOST COMMON FIXES:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Folder name mismatch (new_demo vs new-demo vs new_demo/)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Files uploaded to wrong location"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ .htaccess syntax not compatible with HostGator"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ mod_rewrite disabled by hosting provider"
echo ""

echo "üìÅ Files ready for upload in: deploy-new_demo/"
echo "üîÑ After each change, clear browser cache with Cmd+Shift+R"
