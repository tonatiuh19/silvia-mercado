# üîß Troubleshooting 404 Error on HostGator Subfolder

## The Issue

Your site shows "404 - Page not found" at `silviamercadofinanzas.com/new_demo/`

## Most Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Folder Name Mismatch** ‚ùå

**Problem**: The RewriteBase doesn't match your actual folder name
**Solution**:

- If your URL is `/new_demo/`, make sure you uploaded to exactly `public_html/new_demo/`
- The `.htaccess` file shows `RewriteBase /new_demo/` which should match your folder

### 2. **Missing Index File** ‚ùå

**Problem**: HostGator can't find the index.html
**Solution**: Make sure `index.html` is directly in your subfolder, not in a sub-directory

### 3. **Apache Module Not Enabled** ‚ùå

**Problem**: mod_rewrite might not be working
**Solution**: Add this to the TOP of your `.htaccess` file:

```apache
# Force enable mod_rewrite (sometimes needed on shared hosting)
<IfModule !mod_rewrite.c>
    LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
</IfModule>
```

### 4. **Incorrect File Permissions** ‚ùå

**Problem**: Files don't have correct permissions
**Solution**: In HostGator cPanel File Manager:

- Set folders to 755 permissions
- Set files to 644 permissions
- Set .htaccess to 644 permissions

### 5. **Browser Cache** ‚ùå

**Problem**: Your browser is showing cached version
**Solution**: Hard refresh with `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Double-check folder structure in HostGator:**

   ```
   public_html/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ new_demo/           ‚Üê Must match your URL path
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      ‚Üê Must be here, not in a subfolder
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .htaccess       ‚Üê Must be here
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/         ‚Üê CSS/JS files
   ```

2. **Verify .htaccess content** (should be exactly):

   ```apache
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase /new_demo/
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.html [QSA,L]
   ```

3. **Test direct file access first:**

   - Try: `silviamercadofinanzas.com/new_demo/index.html`
   - If this works, the issue is with the .htaccess routing
   - If this doesn't work, the issue is with file upload/permissions

4. **Check HostGator Error Logs:**
   - In cPanel ‚Üí Error Logs
   - Look for recent errors related to your domain
